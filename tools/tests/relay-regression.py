"""Regression test for the relay's browser-facing guards.

The relay is the one part of Orion that listens on a port, so the questions worth
re-asking on every change are: can a page that is not Discord drive it, and can it
be pointed at a host that is not the activity backend.

Run: python3 tools/tests/relay-regression.py

Covers orion-relay.py. orion-relay.ps1 is a hand-kept port with the same wire
protocol, so a change here needs the matching change there.
